### 1.1 What is Big Data? <a name="part1_1"></a>
  
In the pursuit of knowledge, data is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted. Data may represent abstract ideas or concrete measurements.  Data is commonly used in scientific research, economics, and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity.[^1]

In this era, we no longer lack dataï¼Œ but we can use a lot of data. Data is commonly used in scientific research, economics, and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity.
